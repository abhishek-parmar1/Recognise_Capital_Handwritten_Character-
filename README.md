# Recognize_Capital_Handwritten_Character-

Objective - The final objective of the project is to recognize the images of the capital handwritten characters and print it in a file.

Tools used - Image processing tool box and the neural network training Tool box of MATLAB.

How to run -
              Step1 >  Load the trained.mat ( It is the dataset in which characteristic of all the capital characters images are stored.                          It is loaded characteristics of 2000 images. Charcteristics are exracted on the basis of dct2 ( Discrete Cosine                            Transfor ). Dataset not uploaded.)
              Step2 >  Run the extractor.m
              Step3 >  Choose the image using the Gui created.
              Step4 >  Run the final.m file.
              Step5 >  Open the file result.txt for output. (Output can varry from original because 2000 images dataset is not enough to                          recognize all the character images.)
Working - 
          File1 > extractor.m
